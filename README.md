# ManualNet

## Overview

ManualNet is a conceptual proposal for a new way to handle file transmission on the internet. Instead of sending the actual file, the idea is to send a manual capable of reconstructing the original file on the receiving end, improving speed, security, and compatibility across systems.

This concept is idealized by Jesse F. Marques, a visionary without programming background but with a disruptive idea aimed at transforming how data is transmitted.

## Core Concept

The system works as follows:

1. Before sending, the file is analyzed and disassembled by an application.
2. A unique standard is generated based on the type of file (text, image, audio, etc.).
3. The file is hashed (e.g., MD5) and then encrypted.
4. A "manual" is created containing instructions for reconstructing the file.
5. Only the manual is transmitted through the internet.
6. On the receiving end, the system uses the manual to recreate the original file with 100% accuracy.

## Benefits

- **Security**: No actual data file is transmitted — only instructions.
- **Compression**: Manuals can be lighter than full files, depending on context.
- **Cross-platform**: The system can be adapted to multiple operating systems and devices.
- **Error checking**: Built-in hash validation ensures integrity.

## Use Cases

- Secure messaging
- Cloud backups
- Government/military data transmission
- Cross-device file sharing

## Status

This is currently a conceptual proposal. Development has not yet started.
